#Moving From Scrum to Kanban

The core principles of agile that join Kanban and Scrum are more important to an organization's success than the nuance between
Kanban and Scrum.  There are however, some important differences between the two.  Some consider Kanban a more "advanced" form of
agile, pointing out the falicy of blindly following ceremonies like planning and the error-prone practice of estimating.  I think
Scrum can be done very well and suits teams well when working on new products in a closed environment.  Kanban seems to be better
suited for more established products or more integrated or complicated systems.  That doesn't mean that Kanban is not perfectly suited
for greenfield projects or that Scrum can't be used for grinding a maintenance backlog.  It just means that each system has some natural
tendencies based on its structure.

This deck attempts to explore some of the differences, how to approach migrating from scrum to kanban and some of the potential pitfalls.
