        <h2>What are Sprints (Scrum)?</h2>
      <p>Agile Sprints (Scrum) is a style of agile software development that focuses on iteration or incremental construction through time-boxed cycles of planning and review.</p>

      <h2>What is Kanban?</h2>
        <p>Kanban is a continuous flow of work through a defined workflow controlled by Work In Progress (WIP) limits applied to each step. Work is pulled
            based on available capacity.

          <h2>Kaban is well suited when:</h2>
              <ul>
                  <li>Work tends to switch context or priority rapidly and frequently</li>
                  <li>Work is complicated by several systems, workflows, stakeholders</li>
                  <li>Continuous delivery mechanisms are in place to match the flow of work through the system</li>
                  <li>Workflow tends to be serial and is well defined</li>
                  <li>Team is capable of swarming when WIP is hit</li>
              </ul>

                  <li>Scrumban</li>
                  <li>Produt Roadmap + Technical Debt + Emergent Sales Requests + Maintenance</li>
                  <li>Scrum failed to really achieve intended purpose.  Sprints lacked focus and felt unsustainable</li>
                  <li>Move to Kanban reduced time spent in long meetings, forced local ownership due to continuous planning</li>
                  <li>Multiple swim lanes made work easy to visualize.  WIP forced reality of throughput.</li>
                  <li>Manage a responsive redesign and improved codebase while keeping highest sales throughput ever.</li>

          <div style="float:left;width:800px">
          <ul>
                  <li>Scrum-ban - handle tasks in scrum as kanban and use retros to adjust WIP</li>
                  <li>Create any missing work agreements for workflow(s), Task WIP and Definitions of Done</li>
                  <li>Invest in process improvement to improve flow (Traffic Jams and Air Bubbles)</li>
                  <li>Board visualization is important. Its right in the name. Start analog if co-located.</li>
                  <li>Get serious about cards and the board.  Board tells an accurate story.</li>
                  <li>Incrementally remove the need for time-boxes and meeting cadence.</li>
                  <li>Stop estimating!</li>
                  <li>Work with Product to manage the flow of cards into Kanbans.</li>

          <h2>Shared Services, Dependencies & Stakeholders</h2>
          <ul>
              <li>Regular Dependencies = longer flow. Extend the board.</li>
              <li>Remove dependencies through advisory roles that empower teams with skills and automation (Invest)</li>
              <li>Stakeholders may still want planning to control decision making.  Metrics and visible boards help make teams transparent.</li>
              <li>Roll-up teams and products into portfolio kanbans</li>
              <li>Stand-ups in front of the board are still public.</li>
              <li>Demos to pull in stakeholder feedback</li>

          <h2>Kanban Mistakes are Agile Mistakes</h2>
          <ul>
              <li>Cards with bad definition or no definition of done</li>
              <li>"I did my job" = Waiting</li>
              <li>QA as the gate of all testing and quality = Flow imbalance</li>
              <li>Assigning work to specialists in the backlog = Artificial bottlenecks</li>
              <li>All waiting is bad waiting.  Inventory your waiting.</li>
              <li>Planning too far ahead = wasted time.  Roadmaps are as mythical as project plans.</li>
              <li>Lack of team metrics means endless churn and no visibility to improve</li>
              <li>Board is not up-to-date. Teams not motivated to kill cards.</li>
